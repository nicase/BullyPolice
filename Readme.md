#Bully police

###Bully police was a project developped by [Pau](https://pauescofet.com), [Marc](https://marcamoros.me), and [me](https://camerlynck.io) during the MamutHack Hackathon from the UAB (Barcelona). It consisted in a hate speech publications displayer, working now with twitter and reddit publications in english and spanish. It tried to classify publications whether they were (or not) hate speech with the help of Amazon Comprehend. The project won the Everis challenge first prize.
